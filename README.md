# CS506 Midterm

## Starter Code Instructions

1. Download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files from Kaggle into the `data/` folder
2. Run `test_setup.py` to make sure you can load the files and print the first few rows of `train.csv` and `test.csv` and view their shapes + some visualization
2. `feature_extraction.py` will help you to generate features as well as generate `X_test.csv` which is `test.csv` but with the features from `train.csv` and whatever other features you added.
3. Run `predict-constant.py` to predict the same score for all rows in the test set
5. Run `predict-knn.py` to predict the score using KNN

Good luck!
