However, Python has unique strengths, charms, and expressivity that can be hard to grasp at first -- as well as hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up if you aren't aware of them. Effective Python will help you harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code. Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling Effective C++, Brett Slatkin brings together 53 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and realistic code examples from expert programmers. Through realistic examples, Slatkin uncovers little-known Python quirks, intricacies, and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You'll learn how to choose the most efficient and effective way to accomplish key tasks when multiple options exist, and how to write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and improve. Drawing on his deep understanding of Python's capabilities, Slatkin offers practical advice for each major area of development with both Python 3.x and Python 2.x. Coverage includes: * Algorithms * Objects * Concurrency * Collaboration * Built-in modules * Production techniques * And more Each section contains specific, actionable guidelines organized into items, each with carefully worded advice supported by detailed technical arguments and illuminating examples. Using Effective Python, you can systematically improve all the Python code you write: not by blindly following rules or mimicking incomprehensible idioms, but by gaining a deep understanding of the technical reasons why they make sense.""--[Source inconnue].","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780134034287'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0134034287'}]",False,True,227.0,BOOK,,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Python&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&dq=Python&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Effective_Python.html?hl=&id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"Effective Python will help students harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code.",Pearson Education,['Computers'],,,,,,,,Python,

Kelleher', 'Brendan Tierney']",2018-04-13,"A concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, relation to machine learning, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. The goal of data science is to improve decision making through the analysis of data. Today data science determines the ads we see online, the books and movies that are recommended to us online, which emails are filtered into our spam folders, and even how much we pay for health insurance. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. It has never been easier for organizations to gather, store, and process data. Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning. Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems. The book also reviews ethical and legal issues, developments in data regulation, and computational approaches to preserving privacy. Finally, it considers the future impact of data science and offers principles for success in data science projects.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262535434'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262535432'}]",False,True,280.0,BOOK,3.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&dq=Data+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Science.html?hl=&id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=TFpVDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges.",MIT Press,['Computers'],,,,,,,,Data Science,

Irizarry'],2019-11-20,"Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R introduces concepts and skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers concepts from probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as R programming, data wrangling, data visualization, predictive algorithm building, file organization with UNIX/Linux shell, version control with Git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation. This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture. The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist’s experience. He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie recommendation systems. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so complementing with a probability and statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand the chapters and complete the exercises, you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000708035'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000708039'}]",True,True,713.0,BOOK,,,NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&dq=Data+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Data_Science.html?hl=&id=xb29DwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This book is a textbook for a first course in data science.

Irizarry'],2019-11-20,"Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R introduces concepts and skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers concepts from probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as R programming, data wrangling, data visualization, predictive algorithm building, file organization with UNIX/Linux shell, version control with Git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation. This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture. The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist’s experience. He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie recommendation systems. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so complementing with a probability and statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand the chapters and complete the exercises, you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000708035'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000708039'}]",True,True,713.0,BOOK,,,NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Data+Analysis&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&dq=Data+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Data_Science.html?hl=&id=xb29DwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This book is a textbook for a first course in data science.

It is based on the time-tested experience of one of the gurus of the subject matter. Why should one study data analysis? How should it be taught? What techniques work best, and for whom? How valid are the results? How much data should be tested? Which machine languages should be used, if used at all? Emphasis on apprenticeship (through hands-on case studies) and anecdotes (through real-life applications) are the tools that Peter J. Huber uses in this volume. Concern with specific statistical techniques is not of immediate value; rather, questions of strategy – when to use which technique – are employed. Central to the discussion is an understanding of the significance of massive (or robust) data sets, the implementation of languages, and the use of models. Each is sprinkled with an ample number of examples and case studies. Personal practices, various pitfalls, and existing controversies are presented when applicable. The book serves as an excellent philosophical and historical companion to any present-day text in data analysis, robust statistics, data mining, statistical learning, or computational statistics.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781118018262'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1118018265'}]",True,True,234.0,BOOK,,,NOT_MATURE,False,0.5.6.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Data+Analysis&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC,US,FOR_SALE,True,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6OSvDBE0rCIC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,This book explores the many provocative questions concerning the fundamentals of data analysis.

The last three chapters are somewhat more specialized than those preceding, covering interval estimation, characteristic functions, and the problem of correcting distributions for the effects of measurement errors (unfolding).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780198501565'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0198501560'}]",False,True,197.0,BOOK,,,NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.0.0.preview.1,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JhL2FiF3hO4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JhL2FiF3hO4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=JhL2FiF3hO4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Data+Analysis&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JhL2FiF3hO4C&dq=Data+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Statistical_Data_Analysis.html?hl=&id=JhL2FiF3hO4C,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=JhL2FiF3hO4C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,The book is a guide to the practical application of statistics in data analysis as typically encountered in the physical sciences.,Oxford University Press,['Mathematics'],,,,,,,,Data Analysis,http://books.google.com/books/download/Statistical_Data_Analysis-sample-pdf.acsm?id=JhL2FiF3hO4C&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. Subjects include supervised learning; Bayesian decision theory; parametric, semi-parametric, and nonparametric methods; multivariate analysis; hidden Markov models; reinforcement learning; kernel machines; graphical models; Bayesian estimation; and statistical testing.Machine learning is rapidly becoming a skill that computer science students must master before graduation. The third edition of Introduction to Machine Learning reflects this shift, with added support for beginners, including selected solutions for exercises and additional example data sets (with code available online). Other substantial changes include discussions of outlier detection; ranking algorithms for perceptrons and support vector machines; matrix decomposition and spectral methods; distance estimation; new kernel algorithms; deep learning in multilayered perceptrons; and the nonparametric approach to Bayesian methods. All learning algorithms are explained so that students can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by both advanced undergraduates and graduate students. It will also be of interest to professionals who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262028189'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262028182'}]",False,True,640.0,BOOK,3.0,2.0,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning.html?hl=&id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,Introduction -- Supervised learning -- Bayesian decision theory -- Parametric methods -- Multivariate methods -- Dimensionality reduction -- Clustering -- Nonparametric methods -- Decision trees -- Linear discrimination -- Multilayer ...,MIT Press,['Computers'],,,,,,,,Machine Learning,

Today, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition—as well as some we don't yet use everyday, including driverless cars. It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as “Big Data” has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning—the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge—has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications. Alpaydin offers an account of how digital technology advanced from number-crunching mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context. He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances, with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize reward and minimize penalty. Alpaydin then considers some future directions for machine learning and the new field of “data science,” and discusses the ethical and legal implications for data privacy and security.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262529518'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262529513'}]",False,True,230.0,BOOK,3.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.1.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Machine_Learning.html?hl=&id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=AGQ4DQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications.",MIT Press,['Computers'],,,,,,,,Machine Learning,

Summary Most machine learning systems that are deployed in the world today learn from human feedback. However, most machine learning courses focus almost exclusively on the algorithms, not the human-computer interaction part of the systems. This can leave a big knowledge gap for data scientists working in real-world machine learning, where data scientists spend more time on data management than on building algorithms. Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning is a practical guide to optimizing the entire machine learning process, including techniques for annotation, active learning, transfer learning, and using machine learning to optimize every step of the process. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the technology Machine learning applications perform better with human feedback.

You'll use the flexible Python programming language to build programs that implement algorithms for data classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification. About the Book A machine is said to learn when its performance improves with experience. Learning requires algorithms and programs that capture data and ferret out the interestingor useful patterns. Once the specialized domain of analysts and mathematicians, machine learning is becoming a skill needed by many. Machine Learning in Action is a clearly written tutorial for developers. It avoids academic language and takes you straight to the techniques you'll use in your day-to-day work. Many (Python) examples present the core algorithms of statistical data processing, data analysis, and data visualization in code you can reuse. You'll understand the concepts and how they fit in with tactical tasks like classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification.

Deep learning is an artificial intelligence technology that enables computer vision, speech recognition in mobile phones, machine translation, AI games, driverless cars, and other applications. When we use consumer products from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, or Baidu, we are often interacting with a deep learning system. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, computer scientist John Kelleher offers an accessible and concise but comprehensive introduction to the fundamental technology at the heart of the artificial intelligence revolution. Kelleher explains that deep learning enables data-driven decisions by identifying and extracting patterns from large datasets; its ability to learn from complex data makes deep learning ideally suited to take advantage of the rapid growth in big data and computational power. Kelleher also explains some of the basic concepts in deep learning, presents a history of advances in the field, and discusses the current state of the art. He describes the most important deep learning architectures, including autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term networks, as well as such recent developments as Generative Adversarial Networks and capsule networks. He also provides a comprehensive (and comprehensible) introduction to the two fundamental algorithms in deep learning: gradient descent and backpropagation.

The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. “I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,” the author writes, and the book reflects this approach. Each chapter includes a programming project, exercises, and references for further reading. An early chapter is devoted to Tensorflow and its interface with Python, the widely used programming language. Familiarity with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability and statistics is required, as is a rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python.
